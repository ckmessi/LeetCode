Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

For example,    
Given input array nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

给定一个数组，排除掉数组中的重复元素。    
简单的思路是，使用两个指针，一个指向当前遍历的位置，一个指向真实的保存位置。

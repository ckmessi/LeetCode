### 110. Balanced Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

给定一个二叉树，判断是否是高度平衡的。平衡的定义是任何一个节点的左右子树高度差不大于1。    
使用递归向下的检查策略，同时将检查的结果以高度的形式返回到上层。

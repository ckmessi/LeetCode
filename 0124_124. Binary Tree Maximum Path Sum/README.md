### 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

For example:
Given the below binary tree,

       1
      / \
     2   3
Return 6.

找二叉树中最大路径和，路径的定义是从任何一个节点到另外一个节点，不一定要经过root节点。   
基本的一边搜索一边返回。

### 542. 01 Matrix

Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

 

Example 1:

Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]]

Output:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]]
Example 2:

Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,1,1]]

Output:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,2,1]]
 

Note:

The number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.
There are at least one 0 in the given matrix.
The cells are adjacent in only four directions: up, down, left and right.
